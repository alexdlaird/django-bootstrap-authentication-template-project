We Reset Your Password!

So, you forgot your password, eh? It happens to the best of us. We went ahead and reset it for you to {{ password }}. We recommend that you login promptly, using your trusty new password, and visit {{ host }}/settings to change your password.

If you have any more troubles, contact support at {{ site_url }}/support and we'll get this straightened out for you.

Cheers,
The My Project Team
